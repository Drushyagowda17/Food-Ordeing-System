### Method 1: Direct File Placement (Recommended for Pre-loaded Dishes)

The application comes with pre-loaded sample dishes that reference specific image names. To add real photos for these dishes:

1. **Navigate to the images folder:**
   ```
   c:\Users\vaish\OneDrive\Desktop\food1\static\img\dishes\
   ```

2. **Add images with these exact filenames:**

   **SpiceHub (Indian Restaurant):**
   - `paneer-butter-masala.jpg`
   - `masala-dosa.jpg`
   - `samosa.jpg`
   - `chicken-biryani.jpg`

   **GrillHouse (BBQ):**
   - `paneer-tikka.jpg`
   - `veg-manchurian.jpg`
   - `bbq-ribs.jpg`
   - `chicken-shawarma.jpg`
   - `buffalo-wings.jpg`

3. **Restart the application** to see the new images

### Method 2: Upload Through Web Interface

1. **Start the application:** `python app.py`
2. **Login as restaurant owner** (see credentials above)
3. **Go to Owner Dashboard**
4. **Click "Add New Dish" or "Edit" existing dish**
5. **Use the image upload field**
6. **Images appear immediately (no restart needed)**

### 🖼️ Image Requirements

**Supported Formats:**
- PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF
- Maximum file size: 16MB

**Recommended Specifications:**
- **Resolution:** 800x600 pixels or higher
- **Aspect ratio:** 4:3 or 16:9 (looks best in the layout)
- **File size:** Under 2MB for faster loading
- **Quality:** High quality, well-lit food photos work best

### 📋 Step-by-Step Photo Addition Example

**To add a photo for "Paneer Butter Masala":**

1. **Get your image file** (e.g., `my-paneer-photo.jpg`)
2. **Rename it to:** `paneer-butter-masala.jpg`
3. **Copy it to:** `static\img\dishes\` folder
4. **Restart the application**
5. **Visit the menu page** - your image will now appear

### 🔄 Image Management

**Current Status:**
- All dishes currently use `default.jpg` as placeholder
- You can replace this with actual food photos

**Where Images Appear:**
- Homepage (featured dishes section)
- Menu page (all dishes)
- Individual dish detail pages
- Shopping cart
- Checkout page
- Order history
- Bills/Invoices

**File Organization:**
```
static/
└── img/
    └── dishes/
        ├── default.jpg (placeholder)
        ├── paneer-butter-masala.jpg
        ├── chicken-biryani.jpg
        ├── margherita-pizza.jpg
        └── ... (other dish images)
```

### 🎯 Pro Tips for Adding Photos

1. **Use descriptive filenames** that match your dish names
2. **Optimize images** before uploading (compress to reduce file size)
3. **Consistent styling** - use similar lighting and angles for professional look
4. **Backup originals** - keep original high-resolution images separately
5. **Test on mobile** - ensure images look good on all devices

### 🚨 Troubleshooting Images

**Image not showing?**
- Check filename spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify file is in correct folder: `static/img/dishes/`
- Ensure supported format (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- Restart application after adding files directly

**Image too large?**
- Resize to max 1200x900 pixels
- Compress using online tools or image editors
- Keep under 2MB for best performance

**Upload not working?**
- Check file size (max 16MB)
- Verify internet connection
- Try different image format
- Clear browser cache and retry

## 🗄 Database Setup Details

### Automatic Setup

### 🔧 Admin Troubleshooting

**Can't see pending approvals?**
- Check if owners completed registration
- Verify admin login credentials
- Refresh the page

**Approval not working?**
- Check database connection
- Verify admin permissions
- Look for error messages in browser console

**Owner still can't login after approval?**
- Confirm approval was successful
- Check owner is using correct credentials
- Verify owner is trying `/owner-login` not `/customer-login`

### 📝 Admin Notes
